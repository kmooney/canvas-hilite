Canvas Highlighter 

The library to use is in /lib, and there is a test file which is used by Selenium to verify that this is working in /test.

Here's what still needs to be done:
   o Highlighting tools need changes to turn off AFTER the toggle character is displayed.
   o Word wrap
   o Horizontal View port (when wrap is off)
   o Start w/ javascript, then php tools.  Modular tool library.
